# Skyrim lines

This is a collection of exported lines of dialogue from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

In the `lines` folder, you can find a collection of dialogue lines in each of Skyrim's languages. The sentences are aligned between different language files.

In the `meta.tsv` file, you can find a tsv file with metadata about some of the English dialogue lines and audio files (e.g. emotion or contextual info for certain lines). These are not associated with the corresponding lines in `lines`, but they can be associated by comparing dialogue text with `lines/skyrim_strings_en.tsv`.

I plan on using these multi-language dialogue lines for language-learning purposes.
